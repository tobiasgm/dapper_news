Learning the mean stack...

My take on the "flapper-news" tutorial from thinkster:  
https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial

Todo
----
As suggested in the tutorial:  
~~feature downvote: Implement a 'downvoting' feature~~  
~~feature vote once: Only allow authenticated users to vote once.~~    
feature number of comments: Display the number of comments next to each post on the main page  
feature hide new comments box: use ng-hide to hide the 'new comment' and 'new post' input box until a user clicks a button to see the field  
feature specify name when commenting: Create an 'Author' field so people can specify their name when commenting  

Other stuff:  
feature delete post  
feature delete comment
security issues
other methods for authentication (facebook..)
